# Test Project 4

For this project we will use the I-94 Interstate Highway Westbound Traffic Dataset to perform some exploration and analysis using the matplotlib.pyplot library.
We will analyze this dataset in order to find indicators of heavy traffic in the I-94 Interstate Highway for vehicles going from Saint Paul to Minneapolis (east to west) in United States. 
The goal is to know what events cause the greater ammount of traffic.

Information about the dataset can be found in the following link.
